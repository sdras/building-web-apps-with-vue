# Building Web Apps with Vue and Nuxt

Course Materials

_Author: Sarah Drasner_

## Upcoming workshop live on Sept 25, 2020, [join here](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/building-apps-vue/)

This repo houses the materials and resources for the Building Web Apps with Vue and Nuxt course on Frontend Masters. This course uses Vue 3.

Most of the materials for the course are outlined below, but there are also directories housed here of very basic examples of some of the techniques we will cover so that students don't have to spend a lot of time researching in order to get started.

This workshop is mostly spent live coding, and I get a lot of questions about my local environment, here are all of the things I'm using:

- Here are the [Vue chrome devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en)
- Here are the snippets I'll be using [vue vscode snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets)
- My VS Code theme [NightOwl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl)
- My terminal is [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) and I'm using [Hyperpower](https://hyper.is/store/hyperpower) for the particles
- I'm using [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) to create repos on my terminal
- I wrote an [article that might be helpful to you](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/12/speed-up-productivity-with-terminal-aliases/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=vuecourse-sd&utm_campaign=devex) on how I set up my bash aliases I use in this course
- I use [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) to gather snippets that I reuse for multiple projects
